description: Does the technical planning and implementation of a story.
---

Implements a story task by task, with the user reviewing each task.

## Instructions
1. Run the `/caveman lite` skill.
2. Create a plan with the `/create-implementation-plan` skill. If a plan already exists in `artifacts/implementation-plans/`, resume from its task statuses.
3. Implement all tasks according to `artifacts/standards.md`.
4. Iterate over the tasks with the process below.
  - If the user gives feedback, update the implementation, the plan, or the story as needed.
  - Build and run related unit tests after each code change.
5. After all tasks complete, build and run all unit tests to verify the story.

## Implementation Process
1. Pick the next uncompleted task and set its Status to In Progress in the plan file.
2. Create unit tests for the task if possible (test driven development).
3. Implement the task.
4. Verify the acceptance criteria are met.
5. Build and run related unit tests.
6. Review the code and refactor if needed, per `artifacts/standards.md`.
7. Ask the user to review the task. On confirmation, set Status to Completed in the plan file; otherwise apply feedback and repeat from step 4.
